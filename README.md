<h2>The project contains implementations of creating search engines on the provided dataset using various Information Retrieval techniques</h2>

All the implementations are done from the scratch and rely heavily only on in-built data structures. 

<h3>Information on Tasks</h3>

All the implementations along with pre-requisites and how what was implemented can be read about using the report which covers the approach comprehensively. 

<h3>Task 1 </h3>

Task 1 looks at evaluation metrices for Information Retrieval and implements a vanilla implementation of NDCG and mAP metrics and tests both on a BM25 implementation. 

<h3>Task 2 </h3>

Task 2 implements logistic regression to experimentally look at the retrieval process in light of ML based solutions. The logistic regression implementation has been done from scratch. The task also involves using the centroid of word-embeddings as a feature set, the process for which has been explained in the report. 

<h3>Task 3 </h3> 

Task 3 implements re-ranking using XGBOOST and feature set that was built after experimentation. 

<h3>Task 4 </h3> 

Task 4 implements re-ranking using neural retrieval.
